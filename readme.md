## The story behind this code

![preview](https://i.ibb.co/hcWKv0Z/image.png)

I had a job interview where I was asked how I would design a snake game system, and I did not have a good answer.
So I decided to get my hands dirty and run a snake game by myself.
I found the initial code at [educative.io](https://www.educative.io/blog/javascript-snake-game-tutorial) .
I refactor the code and added new features.

## How to run the code?

To run the code you need to download it and run the html file in your web browser.
